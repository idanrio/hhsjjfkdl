Priority 1: Code Cleanup and Deduplication

System-Wide Code Audit

Examine all components systematically to identify duplicated code
Use grep or static analysis tools to find repeated functions across files
Document each instance of duplication for methodical removal
Create a list of all duplicate UI elements (buttons, panels, dialogs)


Eliminate Duplicated UI Elements

Remove redundant buttons that perform the same function
Consolidate duplicated content into single, reusable components
Ensure each function is represented by only one UI control
Verify that removal doesn't break existing functionality


Refactor Duplicated Functions

Create shared utility functions to replace duplicated code
Implement proper dependency injection for shared functionality
Test each refactored function to ensure correct operation
Document the new centralized approach for future reference



Priority 2: Fix Critical Functionality Issues

Implement Asset Switching Mechanism

Add functionality to switch between assets (Stocks, Crypto, Indices) via asset name click
Ensure proper TradingView integration for live, real-time data
Test switching mechanism with all supported asset types
Verify that chart data updates correctly after switching


Fix Replay Button Functionality

Debug current replay button implementation
Implement proper integration with TradingView replay functionality
Ensure timeline controls match TradingView's native behavior
Test replay with different timeframes and asset types



Priority 3: Layout and Position Improvements

Reorganize Positions/Orders Layout

Move positions and orders panel to be side-by-side with TradingView chart
Ensure responsive behavior for different screen sizes
Maintain data synchronization between positions panel and chart
Test UI interactions to verify usability improvements


Optimize Component Hierarchy

Review entire component structure for logical organization
Ensure parent-child relationships make sense for data flow
Simplify overly complex nested components
Document the new optimized structure for future development



Implementation Approach
For each task:

First examine the codebase to understand current implementation
Create a backup branch before making substantial changes
Make targeted changes to address the specific issue
Test thoroughly after each change
Document changes and architectural improvements

I recommend tackling these in the order presented, as cleanup will make subsequent functional changes easier and reducing duplication will create a more maintainable codebase before adding new features.
