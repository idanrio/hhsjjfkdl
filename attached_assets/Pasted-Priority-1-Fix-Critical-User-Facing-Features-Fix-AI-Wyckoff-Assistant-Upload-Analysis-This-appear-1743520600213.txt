Priority 1: Fix Critical User-Facing Features

Fix AI Wyckoff Assistant Upload Analysis

This appears to be completely non-functional right now
Debug why the upload analysis feature isn't working
Verify the overall functionality of this assistant
Test integration with the Pro TradingView environment


Fix Positions/Orders Functionality

Ensure these components are live and working within the Pro TradingView environment
Verify data flow between the trading interface and the chart
Check if orders are being properly displayed and updated
Validate that layout adjustments persist correctly



Priority 2: Improve Core Functionality

Fix Indicators Button

Move functionality inside the Pro TradingView environment
Ensure indicators properly affect the live chart
Add proper event listeners to connect button actions to chart changes
Test with various indicator types to ensure comprehensive functionality


Fix Replay Button

Move functionality inside the Pro TradingView environment
Implement proper connection to chart replay features
Ensure timeline controls work correctly
Verify speed and playback options function as expected



Priority 3: New Feature Development

Create Paper Trading Environment

Design demo account system with $150,000 starting balance
Implement account creation flow during user signup
Develop position/order placement integrated with TradingView charts
Build dynamic PNL calculation and visualization (green for profit, red for losses)
Ensure proper integration with leverage settings
Create data persistence for demo accounts across sessions



Implementation Approach for Each Task
For each task, I recommend:

First examine error logs and component relationships
Create isolated test cases for each functionality
Make targeted code changes to fix the integration issues
Test thoroughly after each change
Document the fixes and any architectural insights gained

The paper trading environment will be the most complex new feature and should be approached as a separate mini-project after the core functionality issues are resolved.
